## Abstract

Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are a cornerstone of computer security
culture.  Starting in the hacker community, with DEFCON CTF tracing its roots as
early as 1996, they have been embraced by academia, industry, and the Army.
A quality CTF can be an incredible experience, but that value relies heavily on
the quality of the challenges included.  In this workshop we will present the
resources, knowledge, and tools necessary for you to create high quality CTF
challenges.  If youâ€™ve competed in CTFs before but never written a challenge you
will walk away having fully developed and deployed your first. If you are
a grizzled CTF developer, we will hone your skills and expose you to new tools
and ideas for further utilizing the CTF format.  We believe the Cyber force
would benefit from more organic CTF challenge creators and this workshop intends
to help build that bench. Happy hacking.
